Breast Cancer Prediction Using Decision Tree
This project uses a Decision Tree model to predict whether a tumor is Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous). It’s a simple example of how machine learning can help solve real-world problems, like assisting doctors in diagnosing breast cancer.

How It Works
The program is built using Python and trained on real-world breast cancer data.
It uses a Decision Tree to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
You can test the program by editing the script to include your own image.
Getting Started
No coding experience? Don’t worry! Follow these steps:

1. Install Python
Download and install Python from python.org.
Choose the latest version for your operating system.
2. Open the Script
Open the file breast_cancer_decision_tree.py in any text editor:
Windows: Use Notepad.
Mac/Linux: Use TextEdit.
For a better experience, download Visual Studio Code.
3. Edit the Script
Look for the section that says:
python
Copy code
image_path = "path_to_your_image.png"  # Replace with your image path
Replace "path_to_your_image.png" with the path to your image file. For example:
python
Copy code
image_path = "C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/tumor_image.png"
Save the file after editing.
Running the Program
Double-click on the file breast_cancer_decision_tree.py to run it.
The program will:
Show a Confusion Matrix (how accurate the model is).
Display a Decision Tree Visualization (how the model works).
Predict whether the tumor in your image is Benign or Malignant.
What You'll See
A prediction in plain English, like:

Copy code
Decision Tree Prediction: Benign
What If You Get an Error?
Make sure the image file exists at the path you entered.
The image should be in grayscale (black and white). You can convert it using tools like Paint (Windows) or Preview (Mac).
Ask your instructor or a classmate for help.
