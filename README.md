Breast Cancer Prediction Using Decision Tree
This project helps predict whether a tumor is Benign (non-cancerous) or Malignant (cancerous) using a Decision Tree model. It's designed for students who may not have any coding experience.

How It Works
The model is trained on data about breast tumors (e.g., size, texture, smoothness).
It uses a Decision Tree to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
You can test it by providing an image, and the model will tell you the result.
Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to use the program:

1. Install Python
Download and install Python from python.org.
Choose the latest version for your operating system.
2. Install Required Libraries
Libraries are like tools that the program uses. Install them with one simple command:
Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
Copy and paste this command:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib pillow
3. Download the Script
Download the file breast_cancer_decision_tree.py from this repository.
Save it in a folder on your computer (e.g., My Documents/DecisionTreeProject).
4. Prepare an Image
Use any grayscale image representing a tumor (e.g., a microscopic slide).
Save it in the same folder as the script.
Rename the image file to something like tumor_image.png.
5. Run the Program
Open the Command Prompt or Terminal.
Navigate to the folder where you saved the script. Example for Windows:
bash
Copy code
cd "C:\My Documents\DecisionTreeProject"
Run the program by typing:
bash
Copy code
python breast_cancer_decision_tree.py
6. View the Result
The program will display a message in the Command Prompt/Terminal, such as:
mathematica
Copy code
Decision Tree Prediction: Benign
If the tumor is benign, it’s non-cancerous. If it’s malignant, it’s cancerous.
What You'll See
Confusion Matrix: A chart showing how accurate the model is.
Decision Tree: A visual representation of how the model makes decisions.
Prediction Result: Whether the tumor in your image is benign or malignant.
Troubleshooting
If You Get an Error:

Make sure the image is in grayscale (use a free tool like Paint or Preview to save it as grayscale).
Ensure the image is in the same folder as the script.
Double-check that you installed all the required libraries.
Still Stuck?

Ask your instructor or a classmate for help.
How It Helps
This project shows how machine learning can help doctors make decisions. It’s a simple example of how data and technology can work together to solve real-world problems.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask your instructor or team. Enjoy exploring how technology can make a difference!
