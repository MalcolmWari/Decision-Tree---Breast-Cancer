# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Decision Tree

This project uses a **Decision Tree model** to predict whether a tumor is **Benign** (non-cancerous) or **Malignant** (cancerous). It’s a simple example of how machine learning can help solve real-world problems, like assisting doctors in diagnosing breast cancer.

## **How It Works**

The program is built using Python and trained on real-world breast cancer data. It uses a Decision Tree to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant. You can test the program by editing the script to include your own image.

## **Getting Started**

No coding experience? Don’t worry! Follow these steps:

### 1. **Install Python**
   - Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - Choose the latest version for your operating system.

### 2. **Open the Script**
   - Open the file `breast_cancer_decision_tree.py` in any text editor:
     - **Windows**: Use Notepad.
     - **Mac/Linux**: Use TextEdit.
     - For a better experience, download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 3. **Edit the Script**
   - Look for the section that says:
     ```python
     image_path = "path_to_your_image.png"  # Replace with your image path
     ```
   - Replace `"path_to_your_image.png"` with the path to your image file. For example:
     ```python
     image_path = "C:/Users/YourName/Desktop/tumor_image.png"
     ```
   - Save the file after editing.

## **Running the Program**

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Double-click on the file `breast_cancer_decision_tree.py` to run it.

2. The program will:
   - Show a **Confusion Matrix** (how accurate the model is).
   - Display a **Decision Tree Visualization** (how the model works).
   - Predict whether the tumor in your image is **Benign** or **Malignant**.

## **What You'll See**

- A prediction in plain English, like:
Decision Tree Prediction: Benign

## **What If You Get an Error?**

1. **Check the Image Path**:
 - Ensure the file path to your image is correct.

2. **Check the Image Format**:
 - The image should be in **grayscale** (black and white). You can convert it using tools like Paint (Windows) or Preview (Mac).

3. **Still Stuck?**
 - Ask your instructor or a classmate for help.
